Now, of course, he only has himself, L, and... Mello? Though Mello has no use being there, Near still keeps Mello\\'s creepy little finger puppet. Is it so he can make his puppet and Mello\\'s make out? No one can be certain. However, Near does show a deal of respect towards Mello and many suspect he had a crush on him.
