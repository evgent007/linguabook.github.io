If one arrives between 1 hour up to 2 hours after, it\u2019s \u201ccutting it close\u201d.3.) Lastly, if one arrives anytime after 2 hours they are officially \u201clate\u201d, and any time before the agreed upon time qualifies them as a \u201clunatic\u201d (or any other variant of this word).e.g.) If the agreed upon time is 12:00 pm: one arrives \u201con time\u201d between 12:00 pm and 1:00 pm, \u201ccutting it close\u201d would be between 1:00 pm and 2:00 pm, arriving any time after 2:00 pm is \u201clate\u201d, and arriving any time before 12:00 pm makes one a \u201clunatic\u201d.",'(adj) representing the worst of something. horrible, repulsive, disgusting, annoying, bad idea, indication that if the world was ending in an hour this is the "last" of that item that you would want to be dealing with. \n\nCan also be used as an expression of disgust or hatred. \n\n(noun) the worst, lamest, epitome of a chauncey. \n\nAbbreviation: Lau',"Nikki Haley's nickname for Jordan Thomas Cooper used in her first book."]}},{source:{type:"audio",name:"Forvo",url:"https://ru.forvo.com/word/last/#en"},data:{audio:[{url:"https://audio00.forvo.com/audios/mp3/p/t/pt_9305687_39_5945.mp3",author:"JellyWobbles101",gender:"m",country:"australia"},{url:"https://audio00.forvo.com/audios/mp3/n/d/nd_9597432_39_5945.mp3",author:"SimonAu",gender:"m",country:"australia"},{url:"https://audio00.forvo.com/audios/mp3/v/r/vr_9320779_39_5945.mp3",author:"EdwinWalker",gender:"m",country:"great britain"},{url:"https://audio00.forvo.com/audios/mp3/u/s/us_9015755_39_5945.mp3",author:"Kareena",gender:"f",country:"great britain"},{url:"https://audio00.forvo.com/audios/mp3/n/f/nf_9853898_39_5945.mp3",author:"eggypp",gender:"m",country:"great britain"},{url:"https://audio00.forvo.com/audios/mp3/k/g/kg_8971534_39_5945_1.mp3",author:"bjhinton",gender:"m",country:void 0},{url:"https://audio00.forvo.com/audios/mp3/y/a/ya_9467361_39_5945.mp3",author:"NipponJapan",gender:"m",country:void 0},{url:"https://audio00.forvo.com/audios/mp3/m/h/mh_9446602_39_5945.mp3",author:"Matt3799",gender:"m",country:void 0},{url:"https://audio00.forvo.com/audios/mp3/s/m/sm_9305688_39_5945.mp3",author:"MattM94",gender:"m",country:void 0},{url:"https://audio00.forvo.com/audios/mp3/9/8/98_9468274_39_5945.mp3",author:"mmdills22",gender:"f",country:void 0},{url:"https://audio00.forvo.com/audios/mp3/y/j/yj_9823112_39_5945.mp3",author:"Istger",gender:"m",country:void 0},{url:"https://audio00.forvo.com/audios/mp3/9/e/9e_9567265_39_5945.mp3",author:"Atalina",gender:"f",country:void 0},{url:"https://audio00.forvo.com/audios/mp3/c/w/cw_9187295_39_5945.mp3",author:"griffeblanche",gender:"f",country:void 0},{url:"https://audio00.forvo.com/audios/mp3/8/e/8e_9155456_148_5945.mp3",author:"whitelion",gender:"f",country:"slovenia"},{url:"https://audio00.forvo.com/audios/mp3/3/u/3u_9508875_120_5945.mp3",author:"Deliciae",gender:"f",country:"norway"},{url:"https://audio00.forvo.com/audios/mp3/w/g/wg_9233940_302_5945.mp3",author:"Bartleby",gender:"m",country:"germany"},{url:"https://audio00.forvo.com/audios/mp3/i/m/im_9317429_118_5945.mp3",author:"mistralwind",gender:"f",country:"netherlands"},{url:"https://audio00.forvo.com/audios/mp3/g/6/g6_9036730_157_5945_533173.mp3",author:"ret001",gender:"m",country:"sweden"}]}},{source:{type:"audio",name:"HowJSay.com",url:"https://howjsay.com/mp3/last.mp3"},data:{audio:[{url:"https://howjsay.com/mp3/last.mp3"}]}},{source:{type:"text",name:"Compromise Lexicon",url:"http://compromise.cool/"},data:{tag:[["Adjective"]]}}];t.default=function(){var e=s?n.a:n.b;return Object(o.jsx)(e,{text:"last",lang:"en",data:s},void 0)}}}]);
